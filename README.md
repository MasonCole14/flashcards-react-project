### Edit Card:
![edit card screen](/screenshots/new/edit-card-screen.jpg)
The Edit Card page, `/decks/:deckId/cards/:cardId/edit`, allows the user to modify information on an existing card in a deck. This screen has the following features:
- A breadcrumb navigation bar with a link to the Home page, followed by the name of the deck of which the edited card is a member of, a link to
that deck's Deck screen, and finally the text: `Edit Card :cardId`. 
- It displays the same form as the Add Card screen, except it is pre-filled with information for the existing card. It can be edited and updated.
- If the user clicks on either the `Cancel` or `Submit` button, the user is taken back to the Deck screen.
